## Exploration 001: General Ethics

### 1. Study

The domain of ethics is vast, but its most important dimension of variation is whether it is more theoretical or more applied. The theoretical aspects of ethics are inextricable from the domain of [philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/). Ethics is one of the fundamental questions in philosophy, so we will only take a quick look, and not dive into it. The [applied](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/) side is more interesting to us because it gives us concrete things to do to make things better. Interestingly enough, the Aristotle's [Nichomachean Ethics](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8438), considered the foundational work in Western Ethics, is expressly applied!

### 2. Apply

1. Make a search on "ethics" at the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/). You will see page upon page of results on various kinds of ethics. _What is the most generic definition of **ethics** that you can find in the encyclopedia? What are three (3) domains of ethics that are the most novel and striking to you?_
2. Read the [Introduction](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/e/ethics/about-aristotles-ethics) to Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. _Where does Aristotle lay the burden of responsibility for ethical behavior?_

### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Write a paragraph each answering the two questions in 1.2.1.
2. Write a paragraph answering the question in 1.2.2.

## Exploration 002: Applied ethics

### 1. Study

#### The Big Three

The three most important points I would like to you learn and understand about ethics are:

1. Ethics is not about your beliefs, habits, and predilections, but about a **group's consensus on what is the right behavior** of its members that will ensure optimal operation and longevity, whatever the domain or subject matter of interest of the group. 	

2. Crucial for ethics, and thus for all relationships and society at large, is the **individual** ability of every member to prioritize rights and values **other than their own**.

3. Ethics can be about everything and anything, but it **requires whole-system analysis** in every case.

### 2. Apply

1. Read the following sections and/or articles at the [Center for Applied Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/): 	
   - Introductory Articles
   - Approaches to Ethical Decision Making
   - A Framework for Ethical Decision Making
   - Ethics in Organizations 	
2. Answer the question: _If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?_
3. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. _How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself?_ Be specific.

### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Write a paragraph answering the question in 2.2.2. Defend your answer by explaining your reasoning.
2. Discuss the topic presented in 2.2.3, and answer the question.
	 
## Exploration 003: Current ethics examples

### 1. Study

This brief section is meant to show how diverse and pervasive ethical issues are. In fact, there are - or should be! - ethical considerations just about everything around us.

### 2. Apply

1. Ethical considerations often arise alongside _inequal circumstances for different participants_ and _conflict among different goals or between goals and means of achieving them_. Read or skim the article [Emerging Code of Ethics for Disaster Relief](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03534-z) and identify the _inequalities_ and _conflicts_ that arise in this domain, and how they complicate ethical behavior.
2. The coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic has opened up a whole tsunami of ethical issues. Pick three (3) ethical issues specifically created by the pandemic and discuss them briefly.

### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Discuss the article in 3.2.1.
2. Discuss the issues you picked in 3.2.2.

## Exploration 004: Engineering ethics

### 1. Study

This section contains a sampling of ethics in technical fields, directly or indirectly related to computer engineering. As usual, there is a rich variety of subdomains, niches, and specifics.

### 2. Apply

1. The Association for Computer Machinery is the premier computer engineering professional society. Read the [ACM's Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). _How does it mesh with your prior understanding of what computer engineering is about? Did you get a new perspective on an aspect that you hadn't considered up to now?_
2. We live in the era of open source. So much so that even Microsoft has an [Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). _What does it address? At whom is it targetted? According to it, what is the most important element of ethical behavior when it comes to OSS? What OSS from Microsoft have we been using in our course?_
3. We also live in the age of big data. Data drives everything, from science and medicine, to technology and society. Read this article on [Data Ethics](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.2016.0360) from the Royal Society. _What is the main ethical aspect that is hinted at or stated in regards to data?_
4. The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) is the premier conference on general machine learning in the world, and one of the most prestigious publication venues in the field. It will be held [virtually](https://icml.cc/) this year! Read ICML's [Code of Conduct](https://icml.cc/public/CodeOfConduct). _Why does a technical conference need its very own Code of Conduct? Use the contents to answer the question._
5. Artificial intelligence is the most advanced subfield of machine learning. There have been a lot of fear about how AI may be misused or even how a competitive and/or hostile superintelligence may evolve from our current work in AI. Google, as one of the foremost developers of large-scale AI, felt compelled to publish [Principles of AI Development at Google](https://ai.google/principles/) (also [here](https://ai.google/static/documents/responsible-development-of-ai.pdf)). _What does Google appear to be concerned with? What kind of responsibility are they talking about?_
6. Even though it might at first sound like an _oxymoron_, the term _Ethical Hacking_ is not only a thing, but it is so serious a thing, that it has its own training and certifications. Read about the [Certified Ethical Hacker](https://www.eccouncil.org/ethical-hacking/) provided by the International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants, as well as the [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/) organization which [matches companies and hackers](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-hackers-can-help-backblaze-and-the-ethical-hackers-on-hackerone/). _Tease apart the initially inconsistent, as it might appear at first, phrase "ethical hacking". That is, say a bit about "ethics" and "hacking" (as negatively construed), and then discuss how we can attach them together._

### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Include your writing on item 4.2.1.
2. Include your writing on item 4.2.2.
3. Include your writing on item 4.2.3.
4. Include your writing on item 4.2.4.
5. Include your writing on item 4.2.5.
6. Include your writing on item 4.2.6.

## Exploration 005: Codes of conduct

### 1. Study

This section dives into the task of designing _ethical codes_. Peruse this [collection](https://drdianehamilton.com/top-10-companies-code-of-ethics-and-conduct-2011/) of some of the Codes of Ethics (aka Codes of Conduct) of some of the most prominent technology companies, study the codes, mark the commonalities, and detect any significant differences.

### 2. Apply

1. Ethical codes are vulnerable to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). An ethical code relies on the _cooperation_ of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior (aka _defection_) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the [prinsoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) and the eventual demise of the ethical code. _What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?_
2. Imagine you are one of the co-founders of a recent computational technology startup.
   1. Come up with the _technical innovation_ at the heart of your reason to exist and your future product or service.
   2. Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society: 
      1. List at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to _misuse_) of the innovation, as well as some of the anticipatory actions and mechanisms you can embed in its deveopment, distribution, and operation to counteract these effects.
      2. Give an _explicit_ definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of innovation's lifetime: (a) immediately upon launch; and (b) after enough time has passed that it has been absorbed into everyday life.   
3. Your small group of co-founders and first few key employees are the pivotal _social kernel_ that can define the proper use of your technology. You have to start early, and hold the line. _How are you going to ensure that you stay the course?_ 
4. Define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization, that will safeguard your original intentions and values while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have _at most 9 points_.

### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Include your writing on item 5.2.1.
2. Include your writing on item 5.2.2.
3. Include your writing on item 5.2.3.
4. Include your writing on item 5.2.4.
5. **(CHALLENGE)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to _hostile takeover_ of the adopting organization. Imagine you are one of the acquiring team and you are tasked to sabotage the original team. Remove or modify _3 points_ from The Code, at your discretion, to be the most damaging overall. 
   1. Discuss how and why The Code has been weakened.
   2. Discuss how, in retrospect, the original team should have stated the points of the Code, to forestall sabotage and make it _robust to disruption_. _Note: Beware of the [paradox of self-amendment](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psaessay.htm), which, in short, **"...arises when a rule is used as the authority for its own amendment. It is sharper when the rule of change is supreme, sharper still when it is changed into a form that is inconsistent with its original form, and sharpest of all when the change purports to be irrevocable."**_
